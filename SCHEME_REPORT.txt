-Introduction (objectives)
-HOG (general explanation)
-LITERATURE?
-OUR PROGRAM
	- main core (fit,predict,score)
	- CLASSIFIER 
	- PATCH SELECTION: 
		1. First approach: max. probability 
		2. Second approach: NMS(explain method & comparisson with 1st approach)
	- RESULTS OBTAINED FROM PARAMETER TUNNING
		- Number of images
		- Patch selection approach
		- Probability/overlap threshold
		- scale_fraction? 
		- Type of classifier
		- threshold nms
		
	- HOG PROBLEMS 
		1. outliers
		2. rotation-invariance
		3. multi-scale
